  "description": "Follow me on instagram: https://instagram.com/wayoframen\nSupport the channel on Patreon: https://patreon.com/wayoframen\nShop Ramen Ingredients: https://wayoframen.com/shop\n\nMinoru Sano is a legendary Japanese ramen chef who was decades ahead of his time. This is my attempt to recreate his recipe for his shio ramen soup. This was from an old book or magazine and I'm sure his recipe at his shop was not exactly this, everyone has secrets, but my God, it was amazing. But there was a catch. This soup must be eaten the day its made. It loses a lot of flavor if you rest it.\n\nThanks so much to my buddy Erik Bentz for coming on to talk about Sano. Please give him a follow on instagram, https://instagram.com/erik_bentz\n\nIngredients\n\nShio Tare (You probably want to scale this down too, it makes a lot and its expensive to make):\n500cc dashi\n -  50g rishiri konbu https://wayoframen.com/product/rishiri-konbu/\n - 35g mejimaguro-bushi\n165g salt\n100cc sake\n30cc mirin \n10cc vinegar\n30cc koikuchi shoyu \n\nSoup  (scaled down):\n1kg chicken backs\n330g chicken feet\n330g pork femur bones\n66g pork fat\n2/3 onion\n2/3 carrot\n1 garlic\n15g ginger\n1/4 cabbage\n1 long green onion\n16g dried shrimp\n4L water\n\nDashi:\n26g konbu\n2 dried shiitake\n1L water\n33g katsuobushi (thick cut)",
