  "description": "There's no worse feeling than biting into a slice of New York pizza, only to find soggy bread, congealed sauce, and a thin layer of dried-out cheese. Though it rarely gets enough shine, the enigmatic \"upside-down\" Sicilian has an answer to these common pizza problems, topping its melted mozzarella with ladles of steaming tomato sauce. Scarr Pimental—the owner of Scarr's Pizza on the Lower East Side—is bringing the city's upside-down Sicilian to the masses, building on a style made famous by NYC pizza masters like L&B Spumoni Gardens in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. Crisp, fresh, and packed with flavor, upside-down pizza proves there's no such thing as \"too much sauce\" when it comes to the perfect slice. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",
