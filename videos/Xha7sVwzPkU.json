Iida-san passion for ramen was inspired by the ramen demon, Sano-san and today he carries on his legacy of ultra-refined ramen. When I asked my buddies Abram (Ramen Beast) and Brian (Ramen Adventures) where I should go to eat the best shoyu ramen, they immediately said Iida Shouten, and coming from those guys who eat ramen professionally, that is saying a lot.\n\nIida-san recently did a segment for a popular Japanese documentary TV show called Jounetsu Tairiku where he demonstrated how to turn instant ramen into a more authentic bowl of shoyu ramen. Being that he is famous for his shoyu ramen, I had to try it out.\n\nIida Shouten: https://r.iidashouten.com/\nOriginal Video:ã€€https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIOBbWOG9NI\n\nFollow my buddies who were in the video:\nRamen Adventure: https://instagram.com/ramenadventures\nRamen Beast: https://instagram.com/ramen_beast\nNama Japan: https://namajapantv",
