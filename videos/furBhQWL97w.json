  "description": "No cocktail channels \"Mad Men\" more than the old fashioned, but there have been different iterations of this drink across the ages. The version sipped in the \"Mad Men\" era wasn't the same as the most old-school version of this drink. We enlisted bartender Eben Freeman of NYC's The Butterfly to show us the differences between time periods, and to imagine a version of this stiff one that may be popular in the future. Check out his concoctions in the video, and scope out the recipes here:  http://www.zagat.com/v/one-cocktail-three-ways-the-old-fashioned",
