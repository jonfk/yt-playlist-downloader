  "description": "Join Andy Baraghani in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as he makes chicken and tomato stew with caramelized onions. Cooking lemon slices to almost-burnt adds a layer of complex flavor to this comforting dish. Cinnamon's sweet, earthy flavor tames tomatoes' juicy acidity. Apply this same thinking to other baking spices like nutmeg and cloves.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-and-tomato-stew-with-caramelized-lemon\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
