  "description": "One of the most classic breakfast dishes you can find in Thailand is congee or \"jok\". Congee is originally Chinese, but the Thai version has its own unique style namely we use jasmine rice for more aromatic porridge, and we always add tender, delicious pork meatballs. \n\nThis version I'm showing you uses leftover rice, and is super quick and easy and cooks in 15 minutes! \n\nFor the traditional \"long cooking\" method for congee, see this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1diYpl-Uek\n\nJOIN US ON PATREON FOR BONUS CONTENT: https://www.patreon.com/pailinskitchen\n\nMY KITCHEN TOOLS & INGREDIENTS: https://kit.co/hotthaikitchen\n\nWRITTEN RECIPES: https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/quick-congee\n\nMY COOKBOOK: https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/htk-cookbook/\n\nCONNECT WITH ME!\nhttps://facebook.com/HotThaiKitchen\nhttps://instagram.com/HotThaiKitchen\nhttps://twitter.com/HotThaiKitchen\nhttps://www.pinterest.com/hotthaikitchen\n\nAbout Pai:\n\nPailin “Pai” Chongchitnant is the author of the Hot Thai Kitchen cookbook, co-host of a Canadian TV series One World Kitchen on Gusto TV, and creator and host of the YouTube channel Pailin's Kitchen. \n\nPai was born and raised in southern Thailand where she spent much of her \"playtime\" in the kitchen.
