  "description": "Video recipe for Dough + Filling of the Quiche Lorraine. This results in a golden brown moist pie stuffed with smokey bacon, eggs and cream. Creamy and delicious !\n\nIngredients\n---------------\n\nFor the Dough :\n- 300g flour (simple one T55)\n- 150g butter\n- 1/2 teaspoon of salt\n- 8cl milk ( 2 drips, you may watch the video for an example)\n\nFor the Filling :\n- 3 eggs\n- 1 cup milk (20cl)\n- 1 cup double cream (20cl)\n- 300g smokey bacon in thick slices\n\n\nCookware\n--------------\n- Frying pan\n- Pie dish\n- Baking paper\n- Rolling pin\n- Knife (if needed for the bacon)\n- Bowl\n\n\nInstructions\n----------------\n\nMaking the dough :\n- Big bowl : add 300g of flour\n- Add the salt\n- Soften the butter in microwave ( 20s)\n- Mix gently with the tip of your finger\n- Add a drip of milk\n- Mix gently with the tip of your finger\n- Add a drip of milk (lol: yes i did \"copy paste\")\n- The dough should be soft and not overworked : this way, it will be crumbly out of the oven.\n- Place it between two sheets of baking paper\n- Spread it to 3 - 4 mm thick\n- Cover the pie dish and remove the upper layer\n- Prick the pastry so that it doesn't rise (you can even put some dry beans on the pastry to prevent it)\n- Bake in oven 20 minutes at 200°C or 400°F\n- This is called in french \"Cuire à Blanc\" ( pre cook a pastry )\n\nMaking the filling\n- Cut the smokey bacon into small pieces ( dice it :)\n- In a bowl : 3 eggs\n- Add the cup of milk and the cup of double cream\n- Season with salt and pepper\n- Fill the pre cooked pastry with dices of bacon\n- Pour the creamy liquid on top.\n- Bake in oven for at least 45 minutes at 200°C or 400°F\n- Low position in the oven allows the dough to taste better\n- It comes swollen but after 15 - 30 min, it will subside...\n\nVery simple dish, easy to make and it can be kept in fridge for a few days.\nWhen you come back after a long day of work, a slice of Quiche lorraine with salad is a prefect easy-quick-and-tasty dish.\n\nHope you enjoy this recipe\n\nGab",
