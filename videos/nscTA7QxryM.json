  "description": "In this new series we'll be going through how to make great ramen at home. Be warned, it's not a short process but I wanted to show you the theory behind ramen so that you can produce your own, authentic and unique ramen rather than just following recipes. Hopefully through these videos you'll understand the basics of what makes a great bowl of ramen. \n\nA bowl of true ramen contains 5 elements:\n\n1. Broth\n2. Noodles\n3. Tare\n4. Oil\n5. Toppings\n\nOver the course of the next few videos I'll explain what each of these are, and how to make them. \n\nFull recipe: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/ramen-school-001-basic-clear-ramen-broth/\nFor more recipes and Asian food inspiration, follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/\n\nMusicbed SyncID: MB01APNV2NMKLAB",
