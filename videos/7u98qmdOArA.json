  "description": "This is part 2 of the 2 part series of making an authentic bowl of Sapporo style miso ramen from scratch. In the last video we made the miso tare, we're putting the final bowl together. I had a lot of fun making this bowl and I learned a ton. The end result was amazing, maybe the best bowl of ramen I've made so far. \n\nIngredients for 1 bowl of Sapporo style miso ramen\n\n50-100g of Miso tare ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fynu0NHY6dE )\n450ml Tonkotsu soup ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNu2UMCmaIg )\n35g Lard\n10g minced garlic\n10g minced ginger\n1tsp Toubanjan\n60g Ground Pork\nCarrots\nOnions\nBean Sprouts\n3g Ichimitogarashi pepper\n3g MSG (optional)\nSansho pepper or black pepper (optional)\n\nDirections:\n1. In a wok stirfry the minced ginger and garlic until fragrant\n2. When you can smell the ginger and garlic, add the toubanjan\n3. Add the ground pork and cook until the pork is cooked through\n4. when the pork is cooked, add the carrots, onions and bean sprouts\n5. when the vegetables have slightly softened, add in 450ml of tonkotsu soup stock\n6. When the soup has heated up, disolve 50-100g of miso tare (it depends on how strong your tare is, you will need to taste and adjust)\n7.
