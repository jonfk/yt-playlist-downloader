  "description": "Join Andy Baraghani in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as he makes pasta with tomatoes and chickpeas. If you don't have a can of tomatoes, tomato paste will work just fine. Cook a couple of tablespoons in a small skillet alongside the chickpeas until it darkens before adding to the chickpeas and proceeding with the recipe.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/brothy-pasta-with-chickpeas\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
