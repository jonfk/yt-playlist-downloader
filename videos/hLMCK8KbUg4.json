  "description": "Legendary Southern chef and author of the new cookbook “South” Sean Brock shares a cherished shrimp and grits recipe fit for a white tablecloth restaurant. Sean starts with the grits, using a thorough technique he’s perfected over the course of his life. \n\nOnce the grits are complete, Sean cooks country ham, seasons shrimp with salt and pepper, and dredges them in flour. Next, Sean slices button mushrooms and scallions. He adds the shrimps, mushrooms, and vegetable stock to the pan, allowing the liquid and flour to thicken into a broth. He sprinkles the scallions over the top, along with a little seasoning and hot sauce, and finishes with diced butter, stirring everything together. Sean plates the dish by spreading the grits evenly across the plate and topping it with the mixture of shrimp, mushrooms, country ham, and scallions.\n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/kz4k33/traditional-shrimp-and-grits-recipe\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nHungry?
