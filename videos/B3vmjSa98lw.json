  "description": "I was feeling in the mood for some Catalan and Spanish food, so I made gambas al ajillo, pa amb tomaquet, and... some stir-fried broccolini with chiles and chorizo. It all took just under 30 minutes, start to finish, no advance prep. I didn't even pull things out of the freezer or fridge until I started recording. You can do it too!\n\nPLEASE READ!\n\nThe coronavirus has hit many folks hard, including first responders and hospital workers, individuals and families who were already food insecure, and service industry employees who are, for the large part, currently out of a job.\n\nMy goal is to help fix both these problems in the best way I know how to contribute: organizing people, and cooking food.\n\nIf you would like to donate to our free meal fund, head to https://www.toasttab.com/wursthall/ where you can buy a boxed meal for someone in need. These boxes go directly to the frontline workers and food insecure families who have been hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic. They also allow me to hire back my kitchen team to cook and pack these meals (in a safe, clean way). So far we have served nearly 500 meals, and the number goes up every week.\n\nIf you would like to make a monthly recurring donation of any size, head to my Patreon account at https://www.patreon.com/kenjilopezalt. 100% of the proceeds go directly to the free meal fund. You can also help by buying my books at bookshop.org/shop/kenjilopezalt where 100% of my sales commission goes to the free meal fund, and an additional 10% goes to independent book stores around the country.\n\nFinally, stay safe. Here is my guide to food safety and the coronavirus, written with the consultation of virologists, food safety experts, and infectious disease specialists, and kept up to date as new research emerges: https://www.seriouseats.com/2020/03/food-safety-and-coronavirus-a-comprehensive-guide.html#comment-anchor-452226",
