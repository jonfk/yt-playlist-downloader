  "description": "Simone Tong of Little Tong Noodle Shop in NYC makes Mala Dan Dan Mixian, a traditional ground pork noodle dish that features tingling, spicy Sichuan peppercorn. Simone adds her twist to this recipe by serving it with rice noodles and adding pickled yellow mustard seeds.\n\nSimone starts by pickling mustard seeds and celery, then chops and dresses peanuts, which provide different textures for the dish. While the rice noodles cook in boiling water, she starts on the soul of the dish: the dan dan. Simone heats up oil in a pan and adds ground pork, breaking it into small pieces, and mixes in Shaoxing wine (Chinese cooking wine), Pixian doubanjiang (fermented fava bean paste), and chili powder. She drains the noodles and continues to flavor the dan dan mixture, adding Sichuan peppercorn, sugar, white pepper, Lao Gan Ma (Chinese chili crisp), oyster sauce, dark soy sauce, and zha cai (pickled mustard plant stem). Simone finishes the dish with scallions, ginger, and garlic, and layers the dan dan mixture over the rice noodles. Finally, she tops the dish with pickled mustard seed, pickled celery, chopped peanuts, pea shoot tendrils, and chili oil.\n\nCheck out the recipe here:  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbmydq/mala-dan-dan-mixian-recipe\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nHungry?
