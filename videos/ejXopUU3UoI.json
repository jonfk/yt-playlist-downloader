  "description": "Let me introduce you to a popular Korean street snack gyeran-ppang (계란빵) or \"egg bread\" today. This is a sweet, steamy, hot and fluffy little loaf of bread with a whole egg inside. It's sold by street vendors all over Korea.\nFull recipe: http://www.maangchi.com/recipe/gyeran-ppang\n\nUntil recently, I had never had gyeran-ppang before. Many of my readers who had travelled to Korea requested it on my recipe request forum, so when I went to Korea last November, tasting gyeran-ppang was on my list of things to do, a kind of mission. I wanted to taste it so I could make a recipe video for it.\n\nIt was definitely delicious, and I could see why so many of my readers requested it!\n\nMore recipes in my cookbook: http://www.maangchi.com/recipe/real",
