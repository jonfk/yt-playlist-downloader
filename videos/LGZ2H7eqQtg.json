  "description": "Today I want to share with you how to make “Shokupan” fluffy Japanese white bread.\n\n“Shokupan” is one of the staple Japanese bread that you can find at any grocery store.\n\nThe size is the same, but it comes in varieties of thickness.\n\nShokupan comes in 2 types of shape, one is square, and the other comes in the rounded top like a mountain.  It called Yamashoku.  Yama means mountain.\n\nSquared one is more moist and dense compared to mountain shape because we bake it with the lid.  The moisture stays in the dough.  Mountain shape Shokupan is lighter in texture. Perfect for toast.  It’s hup to you which one to choose.\n\n1:17 \nThe footage was mixed up with Melon Pan video.   \nI added water as I listed on the ingredients list.\nSorry for that. \n\nFor Hand Kneading:\nLEVEL★★★\nhttps://youtu.be/RwtFmp7Qi5M\n\nFor Beginners:　\nLEVEL　★☆☆\nhttps://youtu.be/YeI7tHZ2XLE\n※I highly recommend to try beginners recipe if it is your first Shokupan.\n\nPlease read the article before baking:\nhttps://princessbamboo.com/important-note-read-this-before-start-baking/\n\nLEVEL ★★★\n\nMakes two 8 inch-by-4inch loaves\n(My mold 188(179)×99(93)×h105mm)\n\n＜ingredients for 2 loaves＞\n\n625g (22 oz.) bread flour\n\n30g ( 3 tablespoons) sugar\n\n12g ( 2 1/2 teaspoons) salt\n\n8g ( 2 teaspoons ) active dry yeast\n\n450ml lukewarm （38℃/100℉）water\n\n35g (3 tablespoons ) unsalted butter\n\n＜ingredients for 1 loaf＞\n\n312g (11 oz.) bread flour\n\n15g ( 1 1/2 tablespoons) sugar\n\n6g ( 1 teaspoons + a pinch) salt\n\n4g ( 1 teaspoons ) active dry yeast\n\n225ml lukewarm （38℃/100℉）water\n\n17g (1 2/2 tablespoons ) unsalted butter\n\nIf you don't want the sticky dough, reduce water to 180~190ml.
