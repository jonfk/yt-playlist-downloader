  "description": "Shandong (or Shantung) chicken is a popular Chinese restaurant dish. Despite the name, however, it is not really a dish from Shandong Province. Shandong’s Lu cuisine is often considered the most famous and influential in China, known for its balance of tastes. It is also famous for its fragrant dark vinegars, and it's the vinegar that gives this dish its name.\n\nIt's a combination of a fragrant sweetened vinegar sauce characteristic of Shandong’s Jinan style of cooking, with a crisp-skinned fried chicken, more common in Cantonese cooking. It was in Cantonese restaurants that this dish was popularised.\n\nFull recipe: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/shandong-roast-chicken/\nFollow me on Instagram for more recipes: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/",
