  "description": "*P.S. There is a sample Bread schedule at the bottom of this description as well as links to my favorite items on Amazon* I've gotten tons of questions from you guys asking for a guide on my bread. This is a more simplified and less complicated (believe it or not) version. With that said, I know this is still something that seems pretty time consuming, but you have to remember that the majority of the time is completely inactive, so it's really not. It just requires a little patience. You know what though? That's what bread is all about. Bread is such a meditational process to me. You're not worrying about your job, you're not stressing about finances, you're just completely focused on one thing. The bread. Hope you guys at least give it the chance to try it!\n\nMy fermentation station: https://shop-links.co/1731275103647500469\nMy Proofing Baskets: https://shop-links.co/1731275198421404974\nLodge Combo Cooker: https://shop-links.co/1731275199884925400\nBread Lame (for scoring): https://shop-links.co/1731275199958906501\nRice Flour: https://shop-links.co/1731275106004669376\nOXO Good Grips 5 lb Food Scale with Pull Out Display: https://shop-links.co/1731275106928209642\nPyrex® Prepware Glass Measuring Cup: https://shop-links.co/1731275107801340391\nOXO Good Grips® Small White Silicone Spatula: https://shop-links.co/1731275108060977139\nBrod & Taylor Folding Proofer & Slow Cooker: https://shop-links.co/1731275109077614410\nMasterproofing 2 Pcs Round Banneton Basket-8 Inch: https://shop-links.co/1731275109227397338\n2-Piece Cast Iron Cookware Set in Black: https://shop-links.co/1731275110665996035\nHand Crafted Bread Lame with 5 Blades Included by Aeaker (Storage Box B): https://shop-links.co/1731275111728965744\nBob's Red Mill, Organic White Rice Flour, 24 oz (680 g) (Discontinued Item): https://shop-links.co/1731275113326204841\n\nFOLLOW ME:\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/joshuaweissman\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/thejoshuaweissman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/therealweissman\nWebsite: http://joshuaweissman.com/\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic - Jeff Kaale: https://soundcloud.com/jeff-kaale\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nMy Tools used:\nMy Proofing Baskets: https://amzn.to/2lZwhsz\nLodge Combo Cooker: https://amzn.to/2KSSIxv\nBread Lame (for scoring): https://amzn.to/2KSygcV\nRice Flour: https://amzn.to/2ugFccW\n\nLevain:\n45g mature starter\n45g unbleached all purpose flour\n45 g stone ground whole wheat flour\n90g filtered water at room temperature\nDough:\n273g unbleached bread flour \n500g unbleached all purpose flour\n175g stone ground whole wheat\n660g filtered water @ 90-95 degrees F\n180g mature levain (just use all of your levain splinter that you made seperately)\n18g fine sea salt\n\n\nSample Schedule (just to give you an idea:)\n9am Start Levain\n2:25 P.M.
