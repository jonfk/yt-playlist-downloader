  "description": "Chef Simon Webster Makes Barbecue Stuffed Chicken \n\nFor the stuffing:\n2 tablespoons canola oil\n1/2 onion, sliced thin\n1 cup sliced mushrooms\n2 cups fresh spinach\n1 teaspoon herbs de Provence\n1/4 teaspoon salt and pepper\n2 cups crumbled cornbread\n1 egg white\n\nFor the chicken:\n4 medium chicken breasts or 4 leg quarters\nkitchen twine\n1 cup Uncle Phatty’s BBQ Sauce\n\nTo make the cornbread, sauté onions and mushrooms over medium heat until soft. Add the spinach and cook until wilted. Stir in the cornbread and the egg white to bind. Set aside to cool.\nFor the chicken, if using chicken breasts, cut a pocket in the side of each breast and stuff with the stuffing. Tie closed with kitchen twine. For leg quarters, use a boing knife to cut around the leg bone end of the meat. Wiggle and pull the bone to remove it. To remove the thigh bone, cut along the back of the thigh to expose the bone. Cut around the bone without cutting through all of the meat. Lay meat flat and spread stuffing over the middle of the meat. Roll and tie with kitchen twine.\nHeat a grill or grill pan over high heat. Make sure grates are clean and brush with canola oil. Add the chicken to the grill. Let cook on all sides while basting with bbq sauce.  Grill until cooked through, about 20 minutes, depending on the heat of the grill.\nRecipe by Chef Simon Webster, Sabor a Pasion. For questions call 903-729-9500 or visit www.saborapasion.com",
