This is something most of us already know.\n\nAnother thing we can agree on: Toasting things in butter makes better things even more better. So why not take her great sandwich idea, apply a bit of butter and heat to the equation, and see what we get?\n\nRather than my normal choice of white sandwich bread, I like the heartier texture of a French-style loaf here. More pores for stuff to ooze into, you know? The key is to slice the bread extra thick and grill extra slow, so that the melted cheese and chocolate drip in and out of every nook and cranny. I'm not going to lie: This is a delicious mess of a sandwich.",
