The average time it takes to cook is about 6 to 7 minutes per Dauphine potato. To make sure it is cooked, you need to wait for the Potato puff to be just about to crack open ( as shown in the video) this is the sign that the potato puff is ready.\n\n\n****************************************************************\nCookware I used in this video:\n\nFood mill:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5Tsqd\nSpatulas:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5UqCR\nGlass bowls:\nhttps://amzn.to/2CLyhzB\n\n********************************************************************\n                WRITTEN RECIPES ARE ON MY WEBSITE\n                  https://thefrenchcookingacademy.com\n\n********************************************************************\nMy Filming equipment:\n\nVideo camera:\nhttps://amzn.to/2x5MDox\nMicrophone:\nhttps://amzn.to/2Oclckm\n\n\n********************************************************************\n                IF YOU LIKE WATCHING MY VIDEOS PLEASE\n                  CONSIDER ONE OF THE OPTIONS BELOW \n                     ( It really helps support the channel)\n\n* Spread the word about the channel and the website.\n\n* Check my Amazon cookware page ( affiliate link)\n   https://www.amazon.com/shop/thefrenchcookingacademy\n\n* Join the Kitchen brigade by signing up on my Patreon page :\n   https://www.patreon.com/frenchcookingacademy\n\n* Take a look a the recipes to my website \n  https://thefrenchcookingacademy.com",
