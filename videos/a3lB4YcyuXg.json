  "description": "Want a meal that makes your family run to the table? I've got one: it's baked ravioli with a homemade sauce. This dish will feed lots of people and is super simple to prepare. Just add cooked pasta to your sauce, top with mozzarella and Parmesan cheese, and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling (you could also prep everything in the morning and then place it in the oven when you get home!). Hearty, rich, and unbelievably flavorful, this dinner should be on your table -- tonight!\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nSince your raviloi will continue to cook in the oven, take care not to overcook it on the stove (when it floats to the surface, it's done).\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPREP: 25 MINS\nTOTAL TIME: 50 MINS\nSERVINGS: 6\n\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons olive oil \n1 medium onion, chopped \n3 cloves garlic, minced \nCoarse salt and freshly ground pepper \n1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme, or oregano \n1 can (28 ounces) whole tomatoes \n1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes \n2 pounds store-bought frozen ravioli \n1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella \n1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 425 degrees. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, and season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add thyme and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, breaking up tomatoes with spoon, until sauce is thickened and reduced to about 5 1/2 cups, 20 to 25 minutes.\n\nSTEP 2\nMeanwhile, cook ravioli in a large pot of boiling salted water just until they float to the top (pasta will continue to cook in oven). Drain pasta; return to pot.\n\nSTEP 3\nToss sauce with pasta. Pour pasta into a large gratin dish or 9-by-13-inch baking dish, and sprinkle with cheeses. Bake until golden, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool slightly before serving.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/168DAMl\n\nMore Pasta Recipes: http://full.sc/PeV7er\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?
