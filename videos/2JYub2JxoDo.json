  "description": "The sauce is bright yellow from fresh eggs, and each bucatini hides cubes of fatty guanciale. This yolk-heavy recipe is beyond creamy—without cream!—with black peppercorns. It's unlike any clumpy carbonaras you've had. The tricks? Omitting most of the egg whites; their water thins the sauce. It's a pasta worth mastering.\r\n\r\nGet the recipe: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/the-silkiest-carbonara\r\n\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
