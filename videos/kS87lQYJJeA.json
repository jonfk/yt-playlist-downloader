It's a go-to holiday dish for many Koreans. I will teach you how to make an incredible version - one that you're family will be asking for seconds (the next day!). We start by making an addictive marinade sauce and then soak beef short ribs in it for 24 hours. Then we'll add some water to it and reduce it until they get nice and tender. It's simple, delicious and perfect for a warm Holiday meal.\n\r\nConnect with us outside the kitchen\r\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/futureneighbor/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/efutureneighbor/\r\n\nMusic by Gurty Beats:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/gurtybeats",
