In a large mixing bowl, whisk in rice flour, cornstarch, turmeric, salt, coconut milk, a cup of beer (you can substitute for Coco Rico) and water until the mixture is smooth. Cover bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.\n2. Prepare dipping sauce by adding fish sauce (we recommend Three Crab Brand (usually available at any Asian market such as H-Mart) to a bowl. Combine in sugar, water, lime and mix until the water is dissolved. Cut in chopped Thai chili pepper to add a little heat (optional).\n3. Cut pork belly into 1 inch slices. \n4. In a 9-inch skillet over medium high heat, add 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil and swirl around to coat the skillet evenly.\n5. Add 1 portion of the shrimp and pork belly and cook for 1 minute — until pork belly cooked and golden.\n6. Move the shrimp to one side of the pan, making sure they’re spread out – and pour about 1/2 cup of batter in the skillet. Tilt the pan quickly to evenly cover the entire bottom of the pan and add beans sprouts on top.\n7. Cover and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the bean sprouts have begun wilting.\n8. Take the lid off, cook for 1 minute.\n9. Fold in half and transfer to a plate.\n10. Repeat the same process for the remaining ingredients.\n11. Serve with dipping sauce and fresh herbs or roll pieces of your cooked crepes in rice paper with green leaf lettuce, mint, cucumber, cilantro and dip in nuoc mam.\nPrepared fish sauce (nuoc mam/nuoc cham recipe (serves 6+)\n\nLINKS: \nfish sauce: https://amzn.to/3ePopU0\nthe best knives: https://amzn.to/3eySxmF\ncamera: https://amzn.to/2NwclLy\nlens: https://amzn.to/387IkLK\nring light: https://amzn.to/3dJSKCs",
