  "description": "== VIDEO UPDATED == I'm uploading my Earl Grey Chiffon Cake video we created back in 2015 as there was a typo in the text (should have been 170C instead of 107C).  This video was shot in our old kitchen and we noticed we improved our video making skills quite a bit.  We kept the same song from our original video as well, since we don't pick this type of music anymore. Thank you for watching our videos and supporting us!\n\nLight, spongy and airy with nice fragrance from earl grey tea, this delightful Earl Grey Chiffon Cake is a perfect dessert for your afternoon tea!\n\nPRINT RECIPE ‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/EarlGreyChiffonCake\n\nPrep Time: 25 mins\nCook Time: 30 mins\nTotal Time: 55 minutes\n\nServes: 1 17-cm (7\") chiffon cake\n\nIngredients:\n\n2 tsp. (3 g) Earl Grey loose tea leaves\n1 Tbsp. (5 g) Earl Grey loose tea leaves\n6 Tbsp. (90 ml) hot water\n3 large eggs\n85 g (3 oz, or ¬Ω cup and take away 1 Tbsp.) sugar, separated\n3 Tbsp. (40 ml) vegetable oil\n75 g (2.6 oz., or about ‚Öî cup) cake flour (See Note for homemade cake flour recipe)\n1 tsp. (3 g) baking powder\n\nInstructions with step-by-step pics ‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/EarlGreyChiffonCake\n\nEquipment you will need\n\n1 17-cm (about 7‚Äù) chiffon cake pan (Do not grease the pan. Chiffon cakes cling to the sides to rise. If you grease the pan, they will not rise as high.)\n\n\nPurchase Chiffon Cake Pan:\n\n17 cm aluminum chiffon cake pan from Amazon:\n\nhttp://amzn.to/1KjtdO2\n\n7 inch round angel cake pan with removable base from Amazon\n\nhttp://amzn.to/1F3sTMt\n\n\nAll-Purpose Flour vs. Cake Flour:\n\nAll-purpose flour and cake flour do not perform the same. Cake flour is more delicate, and if you use all-purpose flour instead of cake flour, the texture will be dense and tough. If you can't find cake flour, use this substitution:\n\nTake one level cup of all-purpose flour, remove 2 Tbsp, and then add 2 Tbsp of corn starch back in. (1 cup AP flour - 2 Tbsp AP flour + 2 Tbsp corn starch = 1 cup cake flour). Be sure to sift the flour 3-4 times to distribute the corn starch well.\n\n\nTips for beating egg whites:\n\n-- Make sure your beaters and mixing bowl are clean and dry. A speck of oil or egg yolk on either one can minimize the volume of the beaten egg whites.\n\n-- Avoid plastic bowls -- even clean ones may hold oily residue that can affect the beating quality of the egg whites.\n\n-- Use a bowl that's wide enough to keep the beaters from being buried in the egg whites.\n\n-- Do not overbeat or underbeat egg whites -- your cake may fall. Egg whites should be stiff but not dry.\n\n\n‚òÖ FOLLOW JUST ONE COOKBOOK ‚òÖ \nüì∫  Please SUBSCRIBE :: http://bit.ly/JOCchannel\nüåé  My Blog :: http://www.justonecookbook.com\nüìñ  My Facebook :: http://facebook.com/justonecookbook\nüê§  My Twitter :: http://twitter.com/justonecookbook\nüì∑  My Instagram :: http://instagram.com/justonecookbook\n\n\n‚òÖ COOKING EQUIPMENT ‚òÖ\n\nKitchen products I use in my videos ‚ñ∂ http://bit.ly/JOCSHOP\n\n\n‚òÖ MUSIC ‚òÖ \n\nMusic courtesy of Audio Network  \n\n‚ô´ \"Crazy Like Me\" :: http://bit.ly/2j9rCmB\n\n\n‚òÖ VIDEO EQUIPMENT ‚òÖ\n\nCAMERAS:: http://amzn.to/1QxqBLN & http://amzn.to/2iPVJRW\nLENS :: http://amzn.to/1R9psKm & http://amzn.to/2cxjtU0\nCAMERA SLIDER :: http://amzn.to/2knY1Fu\nCAMERA STAND (similar) :: http://amzn.to/2cA7vOL\nVIDEO MIC :: http://amzn.to/1Tmi58m\nNAMI'S MIC :: http://amzn.to/2jE7vzq\nLIGHTS :: http://amzn.to/1I84kEk\nSOFTWARE :: Adobe Premiere",
