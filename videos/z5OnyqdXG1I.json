  "description": "I get a lot of comments about what ingredients you can substitute when making my teriyaki sauce recipe. If you can't find sake or mirin, then this video is for you. Or if you don't consume alcohol, then there are some tips here for helping with that as well. \n\nThere's also a delicious red wine version of the teriyaki sauce as a bonus. It's a great option if you can't get hold of many Japanese ingredients. A donburi is a rice bowl and it's just as it sounds - rice with a simple topping that makes a easy one-bowl meal. This version is slightly fancy with garlic chips and chopped wasabi stem, but you could use a little horseradish or ordinary wasabi instead.\n\nFull recipe: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/red-wine-teriyaki-steak-donburi/ \nMore recipes on my Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/",
