  "description": "How to make you own sourdough starter and prepare yourself to make the best BREAD ever. If you never made bread before, that’s where you should start.\n\nSourdough Flavor : Rich and complex. It has wider array of flavors than a classic Baker’s Yeast Bread.\n\nSourdough Texture : Crispier crust, it has a more chewy crumb inside, not compact cause it can have massive air pockets inside, but just more intense.\n\nSourdough Shelf-life : It lasts longer than baker’s yeast bread, \n\nSourdough Nutrition : You get loads of benefits from eating sourdough bread, including gluten stuff.\n\nYou now see the big picture, so here is how to make sourdough.\n\n***********************\n*  LOVE & SUPPORT  *\n***********************\nSupport my work on : https://www.patreon.com/frenchguycooking\n--\nPatreon is a cool way for creators to achieve a sustainable income by being financially supported by their lovely community !
