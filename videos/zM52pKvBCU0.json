  "description": "In the first Ramen School video we went through the process of making a very basic ramen soup base using the \"double soup\" method. This time we're going to use the same method, but ramping things up a bit for a more complex soup base. Using different ingredients requires a slightly different process, and of course a different length of time to get the best out of them.\n\nThis soup base is deeper in colour, richer in texture and will be stronger tasting than our first soup base. This would be more suited to a more strongly flavoured ramen, and next week I'll show you how to turn this base into Garlic Shoyu ramen.\n\nFull recipe: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/ramen-school-006-rich-double-soup-for-ramen/\nFor more like this, follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/\n\nMusicBed SyncID: MB01A5CSTOTOOZH",
