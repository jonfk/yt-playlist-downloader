  "description": "Chef Ludo Lefebvre taught us how to make the perfect French omelet. His version of a French omelet is super runny in the middle, has no brown on the outside and uses lots of butter. Use the freshest eggs you can find, unsalted French-style butter, kosher salt and white pepper for seasoning, and use Boursin cheese as the filling. Trust us, it's amazing!\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nABOUT BON APPÉTIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.
