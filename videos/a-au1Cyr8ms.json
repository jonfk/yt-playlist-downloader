  "description": "Horn Barbecue pitmaster Matt Horn fell in love with barbecue from a young age, when he learned to get a feel for how to make juicy, tender, and smoky brisket, ribs, and other meats from his grandfather’s smoker without even using a thermometer. Now, he cultivates his “West Coast-style” barbecue, inspired by a combination of Central Texas barbecue, traditions from the deep south, and Horn’s Bay Area roots, at his restaurant in Oakland. \n\nCredits:\nProducer: Connor Reid\nDirector: Clare Major\nCamera: Clare Major,  Hanna Lane Miller \nEditor: Connor Reid\n\nExecutive Producer: Stephen Pelletteri\nDevelopment Producer: McGraw Wolfman\nCoordinating Producer: Stefania Orrù\nAudience Engagement: Daniel Geneen, Terri Ciccone \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more episodes of 'Smoke Point,' click here: https://trib.al/6nNEW98 \n\nEater is the one-stop-shop for food and restaurant obsessives across the country.
