  "description": "Growing up in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, The Pizza Show's Frank Pinello often had to choose between three classic slices: the Sicilian-style square, the regular NYC slice, and the enigmatic white pizza. As an adult, the white pie has captured Pinello's imagination and become a favorite among his customers at Best Pizza in Williamsburg. Topped with ricotta, mozzarella, caramelized onions, and parsley, the dish pushes NYC pizza past the old standard of red sauce and orange grease. Packed with flavor and perennially underrated, Best Pizza's white pie deserves to be on every slice lover's bucket list. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",
