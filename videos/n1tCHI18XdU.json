  "description": "This classic North African beef recipe is simple to do and makes a wonderful meal to share. This tagine recipe is like a stew with attitude: seasoned with aromatic spices then coupled with squash and prunes slow-cooked in its own juices. Brilliant.\n\nWhat are your favourite North African dishes Food Tubers? Think we should be looking further south on the continent for inspiration?
