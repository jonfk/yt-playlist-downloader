  "description": "Every culture has its own unique take on barbecue. In the Philippines, the holy union of meat and fire is a meat-lovers' dream. Cooked on skewers and paired with some San Miguel beer, Filipino barbecue sets itself apart by slathering a 7-Up and banana ketchup-based barbecue sauce on slabs of pork and chicken. At Brooklyn's FOB, chef Armando Litiatco takes the fun of street food and combines it with the familiar flavors of his Filipino childhood. Sticky, tangy, and fall-off-the-bone tender, dishes like FOB's chicken inasal and grilled spare ribs are a must-try for barbecue fanatics everywhere. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",
