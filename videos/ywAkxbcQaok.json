  "description": "James Beard Award-winning pastry chef Dominique Ansel stopped by the MUNCHIES Test Kitchen to make his signature pastry: the DKA, his take on the Breton pastry known as a kouign-amann, which now outsells the famous Cronut. Dominique shows us how to make a butter block and carefully work the pastry dough to create a perfectly caramelized crust and a flaky, chewy interior. He also shares stories from his childhood in France and explains why no one—not even his family—is allowed to skip the Cronut line. \n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmpnna/dominique-ansels-kouign-amann-recipeSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchies\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/munchies\nFoursquare: https://foursquare.com/munchies\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",
