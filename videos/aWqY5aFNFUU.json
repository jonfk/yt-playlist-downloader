  "description": "Sue Chan says these dumplings are like the best peanut-butter-and-honey sandwich you've ever had. This recipe is a take on tang yuan, the traditional black sesame dumpling eaten during Yuanxiao (the Lantern Festival). Sue's version is filled with peanuts and black sesame, rolled in more peanuts, and finished with a showering of sweetened condensed milk over the top. We've tried them and can confirm that you should make and snack on them as soon as possibleâ€”no need to wait for the holiday season.\n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/4x5g5p/black-sesame-dumplings\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchiesvice\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/munchies\nFoursquare: https://foursquare.com/munchies\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideos",
