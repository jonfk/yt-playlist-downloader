  "description": "Going vegetarian doesn't mean you have to eat tofu all the time, but with this recipe in your meatless arsenal, you might just want to. It's an easy take on pad thai and while it's not exactly authentic, it's not takeout either! So give it a try.\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \nTo make this dish, you'll need rice noodles along with firm tofu and eggs (I'm doubling down on the meatless protein sources today, but if you want to make this vegan, just leave out the egg). You'll also need carrots, garlic, and scallions, plus lime juice, soy sauce, chili sauce, brown sugar, and vegetable oil for the sauce. Top it off with some peanuts and fresh cilantro, and you've made a dinner that's actually faster than Thai takeout. Watch the video and I'll show you a few tricks for cooking with rice noodles -- they're done before you know it!\n\nSubscribe for more easy and delicious recipes: http://full.sc/P8YgBt\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecipe Ingredients:\n8 ounces dried wide, flat rice noodles\n1/4 cup fresh lime juice, plus lime wedges for serving (3 limes)\n3 tablespoons soy sauce or fish sauce\n1 tablespoon chili sauce, such as Sriracha\n1 tablespoon packed dark-brown sugar\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten\n1 package (14 ounces) firm tofu, drained, thinly sliced, and patted dry\n2 medium carrots, peeled and shredded\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n8 scallions, white and green parts separated and thinly sliced\nCoarse salt\n2 tablespoons roasted salted peanuts, chopped\n1/4 cup fresh cilantro leaves\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://www.marthastewart.com/963088/vegetable-and-tofu-pad-thai/@hub/946620/everyday-food-sarah-carey\n\nNutritional Info: \nPer serv (serves 4): 473 cal; 18 g fat; 20 g protein; 61 g carb; 4 g fiber\n\nMore Vegetarian Recipes: http://full.sc/P0o7Mt \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?
