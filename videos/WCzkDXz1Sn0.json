  "description": "How do you make the best Gyudon in Japan?  IN THE WORLD?!  By using only the finest ingredients.  None of these cheap, five minute recipes for beef rice bowls.  This here is around $50 --- PER BOWL.  This ain't your grandma's Gyudon.  This is beef, rice, onions, and egg, the likes that YouTube hasn't seen before.  This is the Lebron James of Gyudons.  Let me show you what it's all about.\n\nThe recipe is simple enough to follow.  But I'll add it here again:\n\n- 200-300 grams of thinly sliced Matsusaka Beef\n- 1 Cup freshly cooked white rice\n- 1 Kurofuji Organic Egg Yolk\n- Half an onion, sliced\n- Spoonful of chopped Garlic\n- Spoonful of chopped Ginger\n- Tare sauce (however much you want big boy)\n- Checkerboard of Kewpie Mayo\n- Enough green onions to make it rain\n- Some pickled ginger on the side\n\nIf you can't find premade Tare sauce, no worries.  It's simple enough to make.  Just mix equal parts sugar, sake, mirin, and soy sauce.  Start with three spoons of each.  Mix that all up.  Seems like enough?  Good!  Not enough?  Add more and mix up again.\n\nSubscribe for more videos:\nâ˜ž http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=simonandmartina\n\nLike what weâ€™re doing and want to show your support? ðŸŒˆ Join the Rainbow Ladder Support Team!\nâ˜ž https://www.youtube.com/simonandmartina/join\n\nâ˜ž https://www.instagram.com/eatyourkimchi\nâ˜ž https://twitter.com/eatyourkimchi\n\nFor more information about this video check out:\nâ˜ž http://www.eatyourkimchi.com\n\nGet cozy in our hoodies, t-shirts, hats, and more\nâ˜ž http://www.eatyourkimchi.com/shop/\n\nBABY WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR BODAY!
