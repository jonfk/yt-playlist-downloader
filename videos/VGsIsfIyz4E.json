  "description": "I was gonna hold off on making this episode until the new live-action Mulan came out, but principal photography hasn't even started yet, and it's expected to come out in 2020.  So as I slowly recover from Vidcon, join me as I make one of the simplest and most essential dishes in our illustrious human history: porridge.  Specifically, porridge made from rice, topped with a smiley face bacon-and-eggs affair.  Leave it to Mushu.\n\nRecipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/mulancongee\n\nMusic: \"unna\" by Broke for Free\nhttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-free\n\nhttps://www.bingingwithbabish.com/podcast/\n\nApple Podcasts: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/bedtime-with-babish/id1327655367?mt=2\n\nSoundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/bedtimewithbabish\n\nStitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/bedtime-with-babish?refid=stpr\n\nCheck out my playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish: https://open.spotify.com/user/easybakeandy/playlist/04Gp926I7HFqBLVDI2eRJI\n\nBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsite\nBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsite\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreon\nInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagram\nFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebook\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter",
