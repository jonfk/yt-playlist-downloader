  "description": "Chef Sheldon Simeon of Tin Roof and Lineage shares a treat from his homeland of Hawaii: Mochiko Chicken. This fried chicken recipe is made with mochiko flour, a special rice flour made from sticky white rice, and is served with traditional (and mayo-heavy) Hawaiian macaroni salad. \n\nSheldon starts by marinating boneless chicken thighs in batter made from sake, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, gochujang, sugar, eggs, and mochiko flour. Next, he prepares the macaroni salad, which requires perfectly overcooked elbow macaroni, diced boiled potatoes, chopped hard-boiled eggs, garlic salt, grated carrots, and a whole bowl of mayonnaise. After resting it, he dredges the marinated chicken thighs in all-purpose flour and deep fries it in canola oil until golden brown. Sheldon assembles the dish in a bowl with white rice, sliced fried chicken, and drizzles two sauces on top: su-miso and gochujang aioli. The bowl is topped with furikake (dry Japanese seasoning), kakimochi (soy glazed rice crackers), fried garlic, and green onions. Finally, Sheldon tops off the dish with a scoop of macaroni salad.\n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/8xw8kb/mochiko-chicken-recipeSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nHungry?
