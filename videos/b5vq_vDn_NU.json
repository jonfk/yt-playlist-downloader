Add onion and sauté until softened and translucent, about 3 to 5 minutes.\nReduce heat to low and add carrots, celery and flour, stirring constantly for 3-5 minutes as to avoid lumps. \nAdd black pepper, thyme, reserved clam juices, chicken stock, diced potatoes, and bay leaf. Stir to incorporate, then cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and let cook until potatoes are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. \nRemove bay leaf and add cream. Allow chowder to simmer for an additional 10-20 minutes until soup has thickened to an appropriate consistency. \nAdd in reserved clam meat and cook for an additional 2-4 minutes. \nRemove from heat and serve with oyster crackers\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCheck us out on Facebook! - facebook.com/buzzfeedtasty\n\nMUSIC\nMorning Hike_MainMix\nLicensed via Warner Chappell Production Music Inc.\n\nCreated by https://www.buzzfeed.com/bfmp/videos/11700",
