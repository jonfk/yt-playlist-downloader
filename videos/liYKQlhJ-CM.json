  "description": "Chef JJ Johnson of Fieldtrip in New York City is on a mission to expand the definition of the world’s “mother sauces” to include the West African peanut sauce. Chef JJ explains how this “Mother Africa sauce” became an impactful result of the African diaspora and how cooking in Ghana encouraged him to see food through the West African lens. \n\nIn this recipe, JJ combines this sauce, made with carrots, tomatoes, celery, garlic, cumin, and unsweetened peanut butter, with udon noodles as a nod to the co-mingling of Japanese and West African populations that exist in Brazil via diaspora. \n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/jge57y/udon-noodles-with-edamame-and-west-african-peanut-sauce-recipe\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nHungry?
