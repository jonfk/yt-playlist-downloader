  "description": "Join Claire Saffitz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes cherry cobbler. Why choose between shortcakes and cobbler when you can have one dessert that combines the best of both? The lemony cherry filling is topped with shortcake-inspired cream biscuits (so tender, so light!) that soak up all of those fruit juices without getting soggy.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/cherry-biscuit-cobbler\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
