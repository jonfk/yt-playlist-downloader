  "description": "This Hong Kong-style barbecue is one of Downtown LA’s favorite lunch spots, thanks to RiceBox owners Lydia and Leo Lee. They make char siu pork, porchetta, and crispy duck with high-quality ingredients in customizable bowls and boxes. The couple learned to cook from their respective families, who also owned restaurants. They have taken classic family recipes and updated them, but still remain true to familiar Cantonese BBQ flavors and textures. RiceBox is located in the Spring Arcade Building at 541 South Spring Street.\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#BBQ #LA #FoodInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
