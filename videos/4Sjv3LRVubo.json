  "description": "Modified corn starch, commonly found in instant pudding mix, is a magic ingredient for making moist, dense yet soft cakes. My mother-in-law, Gretchen Prisock, demonstrates her signature cake, and food scientist Dr. Curtis Luckett of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, explains why the pudding powder makes the texture so good.\n\nThe study that determined the ideal ratio of modified cornstarch in cake (not free): https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/1521-379X(200104)53:3/4%3C162::AID-STAR162%3E3.0.CO;2-6\n\nDr. Luckett's lab at UTK: http://sensory.tennessee.edu/\n\nOne source of unflavored pregelatinized starch (not an ad): https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/instant-clearjel-8-oz\n\nHattie's Cake\n\n1 15 oz box \"super moist\" yellow cake mix\n1 4 oz box instant chocolate pudding powder\n1 8 oz container sour cream\n3 eggs\n3/4 cup water\n2/3 cup vegetable oil\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1 cup chocolate chips\n\nPre-heat oven to 350 F. Mix all the ingredients until smooth. Heavily grease a large bundt pan with nonstick spray (ideally the kind with flour in it), pour in the batter, and bake for 50-55 minutes, or until the cake seems to pull away from the edges and a knife or skewer to the center comes out clean. Let cool 5 minutes before turning out onto a plate.",
