  "description": "This super-speedy potato dauphinoise recipe is a great idea if you're short on time but still want great flavour. Creamy, cheesy and delicious. Jamie shows you his clever cheats and takes you through every step of the way.\n\nThis easy recipe is from Jamie's 30 Minute Meals TV series first aired on Channel 4 in 2010. All the food made in this video was shared out and eaten among the very lucky crew. Nothing goes to waste.\n\nIf you're in the UK or Ireland you can watch the whole series right here: http://goo.gl/3HV34d\n\nRead the full recipe on page 98 of Jamie's 30 Minute Meals book.\n\nThumbnail photography by David Loftus\nCheck out his videos here: \nhttp://youtu.be/DNDvgWfVNtQ\n\nPortuguese Custard Tarts | http://goo.gl/tVaXch\nSavoury Morning Buns | http://goo.gl/HT024I\n\nFor more nutrition info, click here: http://jamieol.com/D3JimM\n\nJamie Oliver's Food Tube | http://goo.gl/EdJ0vK\nSubscribe to Food Tube | http://goo.gl/v0tQr\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/JamiesFoodTube\nTumblr: http://jamieoliverfoodtube.tumblr.com/\nFacebook | http://goo.gl/7R0xdh\nMore great recipes | http://www.jamieoliver.com\n\n#FOODTUBE\n\nx",
