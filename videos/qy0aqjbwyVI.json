  "description": "Join Andy Baraghani in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as he makes herb rice with scallions and saffron. This recipe is a labor of love. This rice dish is based on one of the most famous Persian polos (pilaf), known as sabzi polo. And while the fried shallots are not traditional (you can take them out if you’d like), they add a crunchy layer to the dish. \r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/herb-rice-with-green-garlic-saffron-and-crispy-shallots\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nABOUT BON APPÉTIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.
