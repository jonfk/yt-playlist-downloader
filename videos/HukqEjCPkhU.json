  "description": "For more cooking science, get my book, The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, here: http://www.kenjilopezalt.com/order\n\nThis  is my most popular recipe, by a long shot. If you're on reddit, you've probably seen it around a few times. The recipe is about as foolproof as pizza gets.
