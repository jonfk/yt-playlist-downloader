  "description": "Oyakodon, or chicken and eggs over rice, may be one of Japan’s simplest comfort foods, but done right, it can also be the most satisfying. Tokyo’s Tamahide restaurant has been setting the bar for oyakodon since 1891. Through eight generations of perfecting this gooey, savory dish, Tamahide keeps a strong tradition alive, and owner Konosuke Yamada intends to it pass on to his children. As customers willing to wait two hours for a bowl can tell you, here the chicken and the egg BOTH come first.\n\nA Great Big Story made in partnership with ANA (https://www.ana.co.jp/wws/uk/e/wws_common/promotions/bydesign/meal.html?cid=EMEAEXTERNALweb070217enenCNNGBSOyakodon).\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\n\nThis story is a part of our Flavors series, where we do so much more than play with our food.
