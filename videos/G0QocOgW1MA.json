  "description": "In this episode of Let’s Get Fat, Justin Bazdarich of Speedy Romeo on New York’s Lower East Side shows Playboy senior editor Jeremy Repanich how to make his pizzeria’s famed St. Louis Pizza. Many of you may not even know that St. Louis had its own style of pizza, but Missouri-native Bazdarich explains why he brought this lesser regarded pie to the heathens of New York City. The key to St. Louis-style is the Provel, a processed, Frankenstein’s monster of cheese that claims to be a combination of cheddar, Swiss and provolone with liquid smoke mixed in.\n \nBazdarich starts off his St. Louie with a crust his team makes by hand and proofs for nearly 48 hours. Then he tops it with San Marzano tomatoes, hot soppressata, house-made Italian sausage, Provel he has shipped in from St. Louis, parmesan, pecorino, dried oregano and red chili flake. After 90 seconds in a wood-fired oven that burns at around 800 degrees he kicks up the heat a little more by adding Italian long hot peppers.\n\nExecutive Producer: Brian Berkowitz\nProducer: Jeremy Repanich\nHost: Jeremy Repanich\n\nSubscribe to Indulgence: http://ply.by/PCqbFz\n\nChef Tips: http://ply.by/r9bsdG\nLet's Get Fat: http://ply.by/fXBy7K\nBartender Confidential: http://ply.by/pvO9i1\nFoodSteez on Indulgence: http://ply.by/Va6CYd\nTasting Notes: http://ply.by/echAyP\nHow To: http://ply.by/2M4XTw\nBars and Cocktails: http://ply.by/xZBoGA\nEat This Now: http://ply.by/iMkcoL\n\nFollow Indulgence on Facebook: http://ply.by/RWkqSe",
