  "description": "Tonkatsu is a Japanese crumbed pork cutlet. A little like a German or Australian schnitzel, tonkatsu is one of the most popular forms of yōshoku (Western food incorporated into Japanese cuisine). You can find it in many forms – as curry, sandwiches, rice bowls etc. – but its most pure form is as a straight tonkatsu. Just the cutlet, served with shredded cabbage, a thick Worcestershire-like tonkatsu sauce, rice and miso soup on the side.\n\nThere’s a bit of an art to making a great tonkatsu, and here’s how you do it.\n\nFull recipe here: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/how-to-make-tonkatsu/\nFollow me on Instagram for more recipes: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/\n\nMusicbed SyncID: MB012JMDKTK0NXE",
