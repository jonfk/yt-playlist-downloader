  "description": "https://chfstps.co/3g6s0hc \nYou could spend months and tens of thousands of dollars building an epic pizza oven, and you still might end up with bad pizza. Or you could build this oven for about 50 bucks (or less). Have fun and get the hang of making delicious wood-fired pizzas without breaking the bank.\n\n\n\n*AT YOUR OWN RISK: If you try this yourself, you are doing so at your own risk. Adult supervision is required. Consult a physician before performing any physical activity. Do not get burnt â€“ surfaces are extremely hot. Ensure that you do not use fire irresponsibly or in areas that are susceptible to combustion. You may wish to consult with your local fire department. Ensure that you have immediate access to fire extinguishment equipment. Do not consume materials that are not intended for consumption, cut yourself with sharp objects, cook on surfaces that are not intended for food preparation, ignite materials that are explosive, or ingest food that has not sufficiently cooled down.",
