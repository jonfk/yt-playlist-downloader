  "description": "My friend norman grew up eating his moms home cooked Filipino food but it wasn't until he moved away and started to miss those tasty flavors that he went back to the source of it all. He spent a few years learning his moms traditional recipes and he's now here to bring it to the internet because to be real... It aint so easy to find great Filipino food on Youtube! \n\n#filipinofood #tapsilog #tapabeef #brunch \n\nNorman Instagram @RareForMNorm \nMike Instagram @LifebyMikeG \n\nMusic by Blue Wednesday \nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday\nand Lakey Inspired \nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired",
