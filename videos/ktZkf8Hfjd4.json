  "description": "Tonkatsu, breaded and fried pork, is the ultimate Japanese comfort food. Elena Yamamoto, Co-Chef of Karasu in Brooklyn, shows us her favorite way to make Tonkatsu: making homemade breadcrumbs, brining her pork cutlets, and mixing store-bought Tonkatsu sauce (Elena says to always buy your tonkatsu sauce!) with freshly ground sesame seeds in a suribachi, a Japanese mortar and pestle. \n\nAs Elena says, it's common to eat Tonkatsu before a big event, like a test or a sporting event, even a birthday, but we think you should eat it every day.\n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/a3ybpp/easy-pork-tonkatsu-recipe\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchies\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/munchies\nFoursquare: https://foursquare.com/munchies\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",
