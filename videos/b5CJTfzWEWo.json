  "description": "The secret to Jacques Pépin's corn fritters? Sparkling water! Although Jacques uses corn in this fritter recipe, you can substitute a variety of ingredients that you may already have on hand - apples, vegetables, or even meat leftovers.\n\nHelpful frying tip: use a wire rack instead of a paper towel when taking your fritter out of the pan. This will ensure that the bottom doesn't become soggy.\n\nWhat you'll need: All-purpose flour, baking powder, sparkling water, whole corn, oil, salt\n\nJacques Pépin Cooking At Home \nEpisode 116: Corn Fritters, 2020 \nSubscribe to watch a new Jacques Pépin video every Wednesday: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/kqed?sub_conf...\n#jacquespepin #happycooking #recipes \n\nAbout Jacques Pépin Cooking At Home: \n\nJacques Pépin Cooking At Home features short recipe videos that transform readily-available ingredients into exciting new dishes, perfect for newly-anointed home cooks and seasoned chefs alike.
