  "description": "Chef Sheldon Simeon shares a comfort food from his home state of Hawaii: saimin noodle soup. Somewhat similar to ramen, Sheldon explains how this dish, found only in Hawaii, is the product of multiple ethnic cuisines.\n\nSheldon starts with a pressure-cooked broth made from chicken and pork and adds a variety of Japanese ingredients, like kombu (dried kelp), dried shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimp, plus garlic, ginger, carrots, and leeks, for flavor. Next, Sheldon marinates and preps some beef for barbecue skewers that traditionally accompany saimin. Finally, Sheldon boils instant ramen noodles and assembles the saimin with green onions and kamaboko (cured fish cake) for garnish and Chinese hot mustard on the side. \n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/9kekpp/easy-saimin-recipe\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\n\nHungry?
