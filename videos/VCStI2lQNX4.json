  "description": "In the U.S., the word \"ramen\" conjures up images of chewy yellow noodles and bubbling vats of tonkotsu-style broth. But lately, a different style of noodle-making has been capturing the imaginations of ramaniacs everywhere. Enter: mazemen. Fresh off a cameo on Aziz Ansari's Master of None, Yuji Haraguchi's mazemen is a broth-less ramen topped with bacon, egg, and bonito flakes. Customers are tasked with mixing the ingredients together, and the result is a heap of gooey, yolk-and-pork covered noodles, sans soup. Mazemen is the perfect bowl for ramen-lovers who crave noodlesâ€”and little else. \n\nSubscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: http://goo.gl/UxFzhK\nCheck out more of First We Feast here:\nhttp://firstwefeast.com/\nhttps://twitter.com/firstwefeast\nhttps://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast\nhttp://instagram.com/firstwefeast\n\n\nFirst We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country's best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect.",
