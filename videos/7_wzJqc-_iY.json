  "description": "In this episode of How-To, Danny Bowien and Angela Dimayuga of Mission Chinese Food make naengmyeon, or cold buckwheat noodles, in the MUNCHIES Test Kitchen. \n\nThese chewy buckwheat noodles with an icy broth are served with a variety of condiments (mustard cured eggs, peach-chili sauce, and fresh herbs) and delight the senses with their cold temperature and spicy flavors. Although this might seem like a summer dish, in Korea, it's common to eat cold dishes in the winter. So next time it snows, try making this dish instead of a hot soup.\n\nCheck out the recipe here: https://munchies.vice.com/en_us/article/ype9vv/icy-buckwheat-noodles\n\nWATCH NEXT: How-To: Make Paella Valenciana with Jamie Bissonnette: http://bit.ly/2hsLmPY\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\n\nCheck out http://munchies.tv for more!\n\nFollow Munchies here:\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/munchies\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/munchies\nTumblr: http://munchies.tumblr.com\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/munchiesvice\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/munchies\nFoursquare: https://foursquare.com/munchies\nMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo",
