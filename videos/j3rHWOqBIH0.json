  "description": "We're not going to lie: Potato gnocchi can be a little tricky, and they require some practice to get right. But if you know a few basic rules, it's really not that hard to make gnocchi that are light and tender, not leaden and gummy. This recipe walks you through those steps, starting with choosing a gnocchi-friendly potato and cooking it the right way. We leave it up to you whether to add egg yolk or notâ€”yolks make a dough that's easier to work with, but also firmer. Finally, we add just enough flour to make a cohesive dough, while being careful not to overwork it to the point of gumminess. The result is lovely little gnocchi in a sage-butter sauce that will prove that good gnocchi aren't out of reach.\n\nFULL STORY: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/03/light-tender-potato-gnocchi-recipe.html\n\nOur favorite potato ricer: https://amzn.to/2Lu5OSL\n\nSee More Like This!\nHow to Stock a Korean Pantry: https://youtu.be/6Ey0jIZwB-U\nHow to Make Perfect Polenta: https://youtu.be/fBPD1NscVyU\nThe Best Mortar and Pestles: https://youtu.be/z_CHzKXzGko\n\nFollow Us Elsewhere:\nhttps://facebook.com/seriouseats\nhttps://twitter.com/seriouseats\nhttps://instagram.com/seriouseats\nhttps://reddit.com/r/seriouseats\n\nSerious Eats is a leading resource for all things food and drink: meticulously tested recipes that really work; in-depth, science-based explanations of cooking techniques; detailed reviews of cooking equipment; and guides to ingredients, dishes, and cuisines.
