  "description": "This recipe is the easiest soufflé you'll meet. It comes from Jacques Pépin's maman (which just means \"mom\" in French) and unlike traditional French soufflés that call for separating the eggs, this recipe has you beat the eggs straight into the sauce. Jacques is here to cook and share the story with Kristen.
