  "description": "Official website: http://www.pbs.org/americanmasters  \nJacques walks us through the recipe for Eggs Jeannette. Eggs Jeannette is an essential recipe for Jacques that his mother used to make for him.  Hard cooked eggs, yolks removed and mixed with garlic and parsley, then returned to the whites and sautéed stuffed side down. Finally they’re served with a mustard vinaigrette. A very easy-to-do, delicious, and unusual way to enjoy eggs. Happy cooking!\nSubscribe to the American Masters channel for more clips: http://bit.ly/1JmUCu5\n\nEnjoy full episodes of your favorite American Masters films: http://www.pbs.org/americanmasters \n\nFOLLOW AMERICAN MASTERS:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/americanmasters\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PBSAmerMasters #AmericanMastersPBS \n\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/pbsamericanmasters #AmericanMastersPBS \n\nFOLLOW PBS:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/pbs/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/PBS\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/PBS\n\nShop: http://www.shop.pbs.org/\n\n ___________________________________ \n\nLaunched in 1986 on PBS, American Masters has earned 28 Emmy Awards — including 10 for Outstanding Non-Fiction Series and five for Outstanding Non-Fiction Special — 13 Peabodys, an Oscar, three Grammys, two Producers Guild Awards, and many other honors.
