His chashu recipe was so good I asked him if I could just do it as its own video and he agreed. What's interesting about this recipe is the use of an oven which isn't super popular in Japan. This is kind of like a double chashu method as first you make a standard nibuta chashu (nikomi) then you roast it to caramelize the outside to add depth of flavor. \n\nIngredients:\nPork belly or pork shoulder\n1 cup of water\n1/2c soy sauce\n1/4c mirin\n1-2 Tbsp Brown sugar\n1-2 cloves of garlic\n\nDirections: \nAdd all ingredients into a pot and simmer for 1:30 to 2 hours or until your pork has cooked through and is nice and jiggly\nlet chashu sit on a wire rack for while you preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit\nwhen your oven is preheated, roast your chashu for 8-10 minutes or until it's nicely caramelized.\nchill in a container with the braising liquid then slice to serve when cold",
