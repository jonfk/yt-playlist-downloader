  "description": "Claire Saffitz Makes Banana Bread | Dessert Person\nIt might not seem banana bread — a recipe made maybe BILLIONS of times — leaves a lot of room for innovation, but this version from Dessert Person is subtly different than your typical loaf. The almond butter swirl on top and almond butter in the batter adds a savory edge and toasty flavor, while coconut oil and yogurt keeps it tender and moist. Claire demos the very easy, quick recipe that requires little more forethought than forgetting some bananas on your counter until they turn brown. \n\n#ClaireSaffitz​​ #Baking​​ #BananaBread\n\nBanana Bread\nSpecial Equipment:\n4 1/2 x 8 1/2-inch loaf pan, measured from the top\n\nIngredients:\nCoconut oil for the pan\n3 tablespoons plus 1/3 cup almond butter (4.6 oz / 130g)\n1 tablespoon plus 2/3 cup sugar (5 oz / 143g)\n1 teaspoon plus 1/2 cup virgin coconut oil (4 oz / 115g), gently warmed to liquefy\n1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour (6.1 oz / 173g)\n1 teaspoon baking powder (0.14 oz / 4g)\n1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt (0.11 oz / 3g)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom\n2 large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g), cold from the refrigerator\n1 cup mashed banana (8 oz / 227g), from about 2 very ripe large bananas\n1/3 cup plain whole milk Greek yogurt (2.8 oz / 80g)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/2 cup unsalted roasted almonds (optional), coarsely chopped (2.1oz / 60g)\n\n0:00 Start\n0:19 Intro to Claire Saffitz Makes Cheesecake\n0:39 Dessert Person Intro Animation\n0:57 Background to Almond Butter Banana Bread\n1:43 Ingredients & Special Equipment\n2:39 Preheat Oven & Prepare Pan\n4:01 Almond Butter Swirl\n4:52 Mash The Bananas\n5:43 Mix The Dry Ingredients\n7:17 Mix The Wet Ingredients\n9:15 Mix Wet Ingredients Into Dry\n11:00 Bake\n11:36 Serve & Outro\n13:33 I Found Them!\nThanks for watching!\n\nFind Dessert Person Online: https://www.dessertperson.com​​​​​\nClaire Saffitz on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/csaffitz/​​​​​\nDessert Person Merchandise: https://www.dessertperson.com/buystuf...\nFor Other Penguin Random House Books: https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/​​​​​\n\nDessert Person Cookbook\nPhotographer: Alex Lau\nFood Stylist: Sue Li\nProp Stylist: Astrid Chastka\n\nVideo Series:\nProducer/Director: @VincentCross \nCamera Operator: Calvin Robertson\nSound Engineer/Music: Michael Guggino\nEditor: Hal McFall\n\nAnimation Credits:\nCharacter Designer/Animator: Jack Sherry\nCharacter Rigger: Johara Dutton\nBackground/Prop Designer: M.
