  "description": "Join Carla Lalli Music in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes 30 minute chicken under a skillet. Butterflying and flattening the bird might feel like chicken chiropractory, but it’s all in the name of crisp golden chicken skin, and what more noble cause could there be? The flatter the chicken, the more contact with the cast-iron pan and the more crackly skin to enjoy at the end. And we wouldn’t tell you to invest in a second cast-iron pan if we didn’t think the crackly skinned roast chicken waiting for you on the other side was 1,000 percent worth it. Using the top pan as a weight maximizes the surface area that makes contact with the bottom pan, which all translates to—you guessed it—ethereally crispy skin. We recommend using a bottom skillet that’s at least 12\"—any smaller and you won’t be able to fit the whole bird.\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/chicken-under-a-skillet-with-lemon-pan-sauce\r\nCheck out Carla's Instagram: @lallimusic\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
