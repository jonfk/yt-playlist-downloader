  "description": "Spring time in the French Alps is the perfect time to do some outdoor cooking. No my butt did not get cold making this film (thanks for the concern) so if you like skiing and snowboarding glove-less in the warm sun, with super long days, then my advice is to head out in April and take your factor 30 sunscreen. \n\nAnyway, I headed to the ski slopes of beautiful Sainte Foy in France (www.saintefoy-tarentaise.com) to make this - the ULTIMATE Steak Baguette. It's a super tasty combo of thin steak, onions and fries in a crusty French baguette. You've got to try it - it rocks!\n\nGo check out this site if you want to see more people enjoying outdoor eating in the mountains: www.thefrenchpisteproject.com \n\nSubscribe to my channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/raduk8\n\nGot something you want me to try?
