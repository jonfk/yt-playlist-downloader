  "description": "I know what you’re thinking, two heads of garlic, are you crazy!  You can relax as the slow cooking of the garlic will dissipate the pungent flavor and leave a pleasing smooth note.  This soup really has to be served with croutons or a slice of bruschetta, plus some coarsely chopped parsley for that freshness.   A simple soup with amazing flavor and fantastic if you have a cold!\n\n▶Get full recipe here http://www.recipe30.com/garlic-soup-italian-style.html/\n\n\nSome of the products I use and recommend:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/recipe30  (affiliate)\n\n\nSend products or info to:\n\nMAILING ADDRESS\nRECIPE30\nPO BOX 416\nMOUNT MARTHA 3934\nVICTORIA AUSTRALIA\n\nWant to post me something?
