  "description": "Dan Dan Noodles - always a favorite.  It's a simple dish, but how could you go wrong with fresh noodles, a pork and yacai topping sitting in a pool of a spicy, chili oil based sauce?\n\nThe first step in a great Dan Dan noodle is a quality homemade chili oil.  We want the Sichuan version here - so be sure to check out our video on how to make that red oil.\n\nAs always, here's the detailed written recipe over in /r/cooking.  If you're coming from the future, note that we did this recipe together with the Chili Oil recipe:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/6y7dkr/recipe_how_to_make_sichuan_dan_dan_noodles_%E6%8B%85%E6%8B%85%E9%9D%A2/\n\nLastly, a huge thank you to Trevor James, a.k.a. the Food Ranger.  Because we live in Shenzhen, we didn't exactly have any Chengdu street food B-Roll handy.  He was nice enough to give us permission to use some of his clips, so check out the whole video of his Chengdu street food tour: https://youtu.be/V9FpUSigyX8 (the Dan Dan Noodles are at 12:28) In his videos they go to some of the tastiest restaurants/stalls in China, so give his channel a look if you like food/travel shows.\n\nABOUT US\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLearn how to cook real deal, authentic Chinese food! We post recipes every Tuesday (unless we happen to be travelling) :)\n\nWe're Steph and Chris - a food-obsessed couple that lives in Shenzhen, China. Steph is from Guangzhou and loves cooking food from throughout China - you'll usually be watching her behind the wok. Chris is a long-term expat from America that's been living in China and loving it for the last nine years - you'll be listening to his explanations and recipe details, and doing some cooking at times as well.\n\nThis channel is all about learning how to cook the same taste that you'd get in China. Our goal for each video is to give you a recipe that would at least get you close to what's made by some of our favorite restaurants here. Because of that, our recipes are no-holds-barred Chinese when it comes to style and ingredients - but feel free to ask for tips about adaptations and sourcing too!",
