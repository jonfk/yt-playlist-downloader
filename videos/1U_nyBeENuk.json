And it is juicy and super tender!!  \nAs you can see in the video, it's falling out from the bones. \nBoiling is more Asian cooking technique than baking.\nWe still consider to use stove more than oven. Even though oven is very popular now days in Asia but not every house has an oven in there house. \nAnd if you boil the meat, you don't have to worry about the meat will get dry out!\nGuaranty that you will have juicy meat!\nBut, the flavor wise, you might need to concern..\nSo you need to add lots of flavor into the water, so the meat will absolve all the flavor you put in!\n\n\n\n\nChinese Style BBQ Ribs\n1 rack of ribs \n7 to 8 cups water \n1 whole garlic, halves\n1/2 inch ginger\n1/2 onion\n2 green onion\n1/2 cup sake (rice wine)\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n1 teaspoon black pepper corns\n2 bay leaves\n1 small carrot, halves\n\nCombine all ingredients in a large pot, cover with a lid, bring to boil over medium high heat. Reduce heat to medium, cook for 1 hour and 30 minutes.\n\nWhen the ribs are almost ready, start make the \nBBQ sauce!\n\n1 Tablespoon hoisin sauce\n1 Tablespoon oyster sauce\n2 teaspoons soy sauce\n1 teaspoon sriracha\n1 Tablespoon white vinegar\n1/3 cup honey\n\nCombine all ingredients in a small mixing bowl. Whisk until mixed well together.\n\n\nAfter my ribs and sauce were ready, I just gave to my husband so he can start grill'em!\nJust lay the ribs on a hot grill and keep brushing the sauce until the sauce's gone, it looks shiny and nice chard.\nAnd you are done!\nHow easy was that?! :-) \n\nI hope you guys enjoy!!!",
