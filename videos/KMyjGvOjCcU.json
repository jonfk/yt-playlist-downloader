  "description": "Birria-Landia is a taco truck in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, that is getting praise left, right, and center. The truck, operated by brothers José and Jesús Moreno, specializes in rich, juicy birria, a stew made out of beef and spices, which the brothers use in tacos, tostadas, and mulitas. You can also get a hot cup of consomé, or broth. The best way to eat the tacos is dipping them into the consomé. \n\nEditor's note: Insider visited Birria Landia in February 2020. The truck is currently open for takeout and delivery daily from 2 p.m. - 11 p.m. Please visit their instagram for more information: https://www.instagram.com/birrialandi\n\nMORE TACO CONTENT:\nLA Food Truck Serves The Juiciest Tacos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MysqcwTB4So&t=26s\nWhy These Juicy Red Birria Tacos Are An LA Favorite | Line Around The Block\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yw_Nhyz5XLs&t=159s\nHow Tito's Tacos Became LA's Favorite Hardshell Taco | Legendary Eats\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2fzboe5BbE&t=21s\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n#Tacos #FoodTrucks #FoodInsider\n\nInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.
