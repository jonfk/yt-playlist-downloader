  "description": "This was filmed many months before COVID-19. \n\nHidden away in the back of Chinatown’s Kekaulike market you will find the freshest and tastiest poke spot in Honolulu, Hawaii. Brothers Junichiro and Ryojiro Tsuchiya took what they learned in Japan as fishmongers and opened up a poké stall, aptly named Maguro Brothers. They visit the local fish market every morning to pick out the best fresh fish, used to serve up super fresh sashimi, grilled fish, and ahi poke over rice. \n\nThis was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSubscribe to Munchies here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-MUNCHIES\r\n\nAll Munchies videos release a full week early on our site: https://video.vice.com/en_us/channel/munchies\r\n\r\nHungry?
