  "description": "A lazy-yet-delicious way to make homemade bread that's functionally similar to baguette or ciabatta loaves. Thanks to Vistal Supply for sponsoring this video!

The dough should be just barely wet enough to have no visible dry patches. Add more water or flour if necessary. Cover and either rise on the counter for a few hours until about doubled in size and then refrigerate (at least overnight), or put it straight into the refrigerator for a week. \n\nPrepare a parchment-lined baking sheet. Wet your hands and stretch the cold dough into a snake the length of the pan diagonally. Lay the dough on the parchment diagonally and let it stick. Spray the top with water to keep it from drying out, and let rise for about an hour until puffy. Bake at 500 F, spraying frequently (at least for the first 10 minutes, until fully puffed up), until dark amber and done, 20-25 minutes.",
