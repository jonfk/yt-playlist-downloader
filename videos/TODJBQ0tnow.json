  "description": "Cook #withme #stayhome - Join Molly Baz in the Bon Appétit Test Kitchen as she makes roast chicken and potatoes. This isn’t the crisp-skinned, high-heat roast chicken you’re probably familiar with. Instead, it’s a melt-in-your-mouth tender, schmaltzy, slow-roast version that’s more similar to rotisserie chicken—except (bonus!) it gets slathered in the funky-spicy-sweet gochujang. And while the meat might be the star of the show, don't discount those buttery-soft, nearly-confited potatoes, which cook gently in the chicken fat. Makes you wonder why you haven't always been roasting long-cooking vegetables—carrots, cauliflower, turnips (?!), winter squash, fennel—under the bird for a built-in side, huh?\r\nCheck out the recipe here: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/slow-roast-gochujang-chicken\r\nFilmed on November 4, 2019.\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo\r\n\r\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
