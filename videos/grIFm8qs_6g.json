  "description": "The shape of pastry tip you use for this churros recipe is very important. If the tip isn’t closed, or rounded off, the churros may break as you’re frying them (we used size 845 tips). Keep that in mind if you’re using a different size—the cook times may vary. The sugar matters, too. Conventional granulated is too fine and raw sugar is too coarse—it won't stick to the churros.\n\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appetit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn\r\n\r\nABOUT BON APPÉTIT\r\nCook with confidence using Bon Appetit’s kitchen tips, recipes, videos, and restaurant guides.
