  "description": "Part of our series on Sichuan Flavors with Fuchsia Dunlop, Fuchsia introduces one of her favorite dishes, Fish-Fragrant Eggplants. Don't let the name fool youâ€”there's no fish in this dish. Instead, this Sichuanese classic is deeply flavored with garlic, ginger, and pickled chilies, aromatics that are often associated with fish cookery.\n\nFull Story: https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2020/01/fish-fragrant-eggplants-sichuan-braised-eggplant-with-garlic-ginger-and-chilies.html\n\nYou Might Also Like...\n\nBoiled Beef in Fiery Sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adBrsIP9n8g\nHow to Make XO Sauce: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4_B-...\nKenji's Kimchi-Brined Fried Chicken Sandwich: https://youtu.be/Tu5FEVUMWVU\n\nSubscribe to Serious Eats!\nhttps://bit.ly/2BIlM59\n\nFollow Us Elsewhere:\nhttps://facebook.com/seriouseats\nhttps://twitter.com/seriouseats\nhttps://instagram.com/seriouseats\nhttps://reddit.com/r/seriouseats\n\nSerious Eats is a leading resource for all things food and drink: meticulously tested recipes that really work; in-depth, science-based explanations of cooking techniques; detailed reviews of cooking equipment; and guides to ingredients, dishes, and cuisines.
