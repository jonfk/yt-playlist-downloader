  "description": "I love baking with puff pastry! It's flaky, delicious, and (best of all) ready to use in the freezer section of your grocery store. Today, I'm using puff pastry as the crust in a rustic apple tart. This dessert really couldn't be easier -- just score a border in your pastry before adding your apples and brushing everything with a quick egg wash before baking. After 35 minutes, this beautifully seasonal dessert is ready to serve (we suggest bringing out some vanilla ice cream, too!).\n\nSarah's Tip of the Day: \n#COOKINWITHSARAH\nAre you making \"Everyday Food\" recipes at home?

To prevent this, leave pastry folded when you roll it.\n\nDIRECTIONS\nSTEP 1\nPreheat oven to 375 degrees. Open pastry sheet and remove paper. Fold sheet back up. On a lightly floured work surface, roll out pastry sheet (still folded) to an 8-by-14-inch rectangle. Trim edges with a pizza cutter or sharp paring knife. Transfer to a baking sheet; place in freezer. Peel, core, and slice apples 1/4 inch thick. Toss in a large bowl with sugar.\nSTEP 2\nBrush pastry with egg wash, avoiding edges. Use a sharp paring knife to score a 3/4-inch border around pastry (do not cut all the way through). Place apples inside border, and dot with butter. Bake until pastry is golden and apples are tender, 30 to 35 minutes.\nSTEP 3\nIn the microwave or a small saucepan, heat jelly with 1 tablespoon water until melted. Brush apples with glaze. Serve tart warm or at room temperature, cutting into pieces with a serrated knife.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGet the Full Recipe: http://full.sc/1d2vNJ6\n\nMore Sweet Treat Recipes: http://full.sc/Q9cvnf\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWant more?
