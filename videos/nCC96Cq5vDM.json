We'll use a base mixture of white wine and mirim (rice wine), along with gochugaru and gochujang to create an amazing braising sauce. The taste is tremendous! We're excited to share with you the recipe! \n\nDakbokkeumtang is similar to dakdoritang in taste but typically has less sauce (more like a curry consistency). Get the rice ready!\n\nConnect with us outside the kitchen\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/futureneighbor/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/efutureneighbor/\n\nMusic by Joakim Karud\nhttps://soundcloud.com/joakimkarud",
