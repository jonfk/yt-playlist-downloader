  "description": "The key to ramen eggs (known in Japanese as ajitsuke tamago 味付け卵) is that they aren't just flavoured by their marinade. The salty and sweet marinade actually acts as a cure to firm the whites and yolks, and give the yolks a savoury and jammy taste and consistency, which is a much better texture for ramen. Two days curing is about right for curing ramen eggs, but you can go more or less depending on the levels of salt and sugar in the liquid.\n\nEven if you're not making ramen eggs, this video has some tips for how to get your regular boiled eggs perfect every time.\n\nFull recipe: http://adamliaw.com/recipe/ramen-school-003-ajitama-ramen-eggs/\nFor more recipes and Asian food inspiration, follow me on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamliaw/ \n\nMusicbed SyncID: MB0199AUCQZDFRK",
